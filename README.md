# ledsBlinker

The repository shows how to use visual studio code and PlatformIO to flash a ESP32 with a code to blink several LEDs
using .cpp programming. 

Three Leds have been configures as outputs in this case but you can define as much as you want and change the delay as fast as you wish. 

The point of this repository and other repositories will be to learn how to program using .cpp with bit a more fun. 

Then a second step will be to advance to a better perfomrming MCU.
